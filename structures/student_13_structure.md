# My Structure - Student XX

## What I See in My Data
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]
 I see the letter v appear six times and arranged in a horizontal manner, with suggested height and width of 6 and 1 respectively. The colour of the structure is red. And is lastly described as a single column.

## What I Think This Means
[Interpret the patterns]
I think it means that I have to create a structure similar to the above description with lego blocks provided in the class

## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?]
it could be a ladder in a playground to simulate military exercise for little children/kids.

## Questions I Have
[What don't you know yet?]
I dont definitively know what the structure is exactly
